# mousetrap

[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mousetrap)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mousetrap)

Mouse-tracking, the analysis of mouse movements in computerized experiments, is a method that is becoming increasingly popular in the cognitive sciences.
The `mousetrap` package offers functions for importing, preprocessing, analyzing, aggregating, and visualizing mouse-tracking data.

## General Information

The `mousetrap` package is developed by Pascal Kieslich, Dirk Wulff, Felix Henninger, and Jonas Haslbeck. It is published under the GNU General Public License (version 3).

An overview of the functions in this package can be found [online](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/reference/mousetrap.html).
It can also be accessed from within R using `package?mousetrap` once the package has been installed.
Please see [news](http://pascalkieslich.github.io/mousetrap/news) for a summary of changes in the package.

The `mousetrap` package offers functions for importing mouse-tracking data in different formats and from various sources. One option to collect mouse-tracking data is by using the open-source graphical experiment builder [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/) in combination with the [mousetrap-os plugin](https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os).
